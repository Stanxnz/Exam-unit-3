# Exam-unit-3
Using the code from my previous assignment so I can easily get into the API by just changing the needed names. Was not as easy as espected, did not get a connection with the API after running my code. Forgot to add ();  to my calling function haha.
 
First challenge, crack the code: “☉☿☽♂☉”
seem to be planetary symbols, will probably need to google them. Yea googling made me find corresponding metals to the symbols.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_symbols
Going to submit answer with a list of the metals corresponding with the symbols.
Holy shit I am the goat at this, people in class said the first challenge took them 3 hours?!

Second challenge, solve poem: “Still flows the Icy Lethe, Veiling all ’neath Eldritch Rime.”
Not gonna lie, I dont even know what lethe is supposed to mean. I guess I will just google it again.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethe#:~:text=In%20Classical%20Greek%2C%20the%20word,forgetting%22%2C%20%22forgetfulness%22.
So lethe means forgetfullness, so an icy flowing forgetfullness?
'neath' is just a fancy word for beneath, but what is eldritch rime?
https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/eldritch#google_vignette
'eldritch' means strange and frightening.
https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/rime
'rime' refers to frost from low air temperature. Like a layer of white on grass after a cold night.
So uptil now I have icy flow of forgetfullness beneath a strange/frightening layer of frost. This could refer to a frozen river.
I know metals are considered frozen in alchemy. River could then refer to a melted state. No clue what strange/frightening has to do with it tho.
https://www.onlinemetals.com/en/melting-points
Okay there is and insane amount of metals that can be melted, I dont think I am going in the right direction. Will try and answer with a list to be sure.
Yea that did not work.
OMG I think I found it, I just now noticed the strange capital letters in the sentence.
https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Constrained-Writing-to-Send-a-Secret-Message
This seems to be a valid way to show a secret message, which it indeed is. The sentence spells S_I_L_V_E_R!!
Ok for some reason submitting silver does not work, although I feel like this has to be the answer. I will try different names.
I just realised I might be submitting my answers wrong, let me fix that.
Yes this was indeed the problem, because I started with using the same coding as last time I ended up having a lot of code that was not needed because I have a better answer submission code then last time.

Just realised I need to solve the challenges using code instead of using my human brain that did it without all the hassle...
Time for braindead coding!

fixed it all, now it says I submitted the wrong answer but it stills provide me with the next challenge as if I presented the correct answer. No clue why this would happen but I guess it means I can still just go to the next challenge.

Think the first answer is not translated correctly because it does not give me the second challenge, should be fixable. It is adding spacing between the metals which is not how to answer is supposed to be shaped. I will need to make a new function that removes the spacing. I console.log the answer and it seems to be submitted correctly. I have no clue what is going wrong. Highly debating going to the version where I just submitted answers just so I can atleast deliver a working code. Sorry Simonsen, but I already did the challenge it is just that the stupid program has decided to not accept it anymore.

Yea I do not care about my grade atp, will go back to the working version. Before I do that, will try and figure out why it is only asking me to solve the second challenge. Feel like it is a server issue, will not grief my grade haha.

Third challenge, This is a transcript of the note.\n' +

    '17 20   20 29 17 24 4 34   24 127 127 1 8 8   17 20   17 10 1   34 1 46 17   48 24 45 12 17 ,   4 34 9 45 17   17 10 1   2 20 23 38 45 12 24   2 20 23   17 10 1   2 20 45 23 17 10   1 12 1 38 1 34 17 ;   127 20 38 29 4 34 1   38 1 23 127 45 23 108 ,   127 20 9 9 1 23   24 34 131   8 45 12 2 45 23   20 48 1 23   10 1 24 17 ,   24 131 131   8 24 12 17   24 34 131   270 24 17 1 23 ,   4 34 2 45 8 1   5 20 12 131   17 10 23 20 45 5 10   24 4 23 '
I will try normal task solving, every number has to stand for a letter so I will keep making guesses for which number is which letter until something clicks. Been googling a lot but nothing seems plausble, will continue to try on my own with a frequency test or something.
Started with guessing 17 = t and 20 = o, because to seams like a normal way to start a challenge sentence. Then slowly but surely uncovered the sentence: to obtain access to the next vault, input the formula for the fourth element. Now I need to make code do this challenge though...
Will start by translating all number and then converting the sentence.
I finetuned my code to uncover the full message: TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO THE NEXT VAULT INPUT THE FORMULA FOR THE FOURTH ELEMENT COMBINE MERCURY COPPER AND SULFUR OVER HEAT ADD SALT AND WATER INFUSE GOLD THROUGH AIR.
Now I need to google what this proces does.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher%27s_stone
Will try philosphers stone as answer as this seems to be what the sentence is refering to.
Forget that there is no way to know wether I got the right answer because the server is still down...
Sorry Simonsen, but I asked a classmate to see wether philosophers stone was correct because I want to be sure before I go to bed. Turned out I was not correct and should focus on the sentence itself.
The sentence lists a lot of elements, so maybe it is the same as task 1 and I just need to translate them. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_symbol
first attemp did not work, but after some serieus thought figured heat might refer to fire which has a symbol too. Then somehow the server gave me task 4 eventhough it still bugs all other answers haha.

Fourth challenge, decode:  "Now that your quest vaines, combine the horizontal and vertical indicies and know Paracelsus 'Aqua Vitae', the cemical element that opens gates.\n" +

It is clear that I most likely need to make another translation tool, but before I dive into that I simply want to try and submit Aqua Vitae as the answer since it says to open gates. Unfotunately that did not seem to work haha, would have been nice.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_vitae#:~:text=Aqua%20vitae%20%2F%CB%8C%C3%A6k,origin%20is%20likely%20much%20earlier.
There is still a chance! aqua vitae is archaic name for ethanol so maybe ethanol is the solution. It was not.
I feel like I will have to translate all the symbols in the grid again (assuming its a grid based on the /n+), then need the horizontal and vertical indicies.
Just noticed the weirdly placed capital letters in the challenge, maybe I should arrange those first.
Extracted all capitals: HOPSUMDTLKWIBCNYERGJQXVZFADPDDGUBPMHMUIUGLDGVDPMDLIUPPJB, does not seem to be very usefull.
remove all the random capitals at the end of the story and got the following: HOPSUMDTLKWIBCNYERGJQXVZFA. This also does not spell a word but it has 26 characters just as the alphabet has so Let's try alphabet as answer. Ooh maybe all those stand for a letter in alphabet and I need to decypher the random capitals at the end of the story with that.
Made a translation table with the new alphabet, let's see if we are on the right track. Decoded random capitals: GOLD COPPER GOLD GOLD SILVER EARTH MERCURY COPPER FIRE AIR FIRE EARTH LEAD EARTH SILVER IRON GOLD SILVER WATER GOLD COPPER FIRE GOLD IRON LEAD EARTH COPPER COPPER TIN MERCURY.
Let's gooo finally progress!
