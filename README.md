# Exam-unit-3
Using the code from my previous assignment so I can easily get into the API by just changing the needed names. Was not as easy as espected, did not get a connection with the API after running my code. Forgot to add ();  to my calling function haha.
 
First challenge, crack the code: “☉☿☽♂☉”
seem to be planetary symbols, will probably need to google them. Yea googling made me find corresponding metals to the symbols.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_symbols
Going to submit answer with a list of the metals corresponding with the symbols.
Holy shit I am the goat at this, people in class said the first challenge took them 3 hours?!

Second challenge, solve poem: “Still flows the Icy Lethe, Veiling all ’neath Eldritch Rime.”
Not gonna lie, I dont even know what lethe is supposed to mean. I guess I will just google it again.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethe#:~:text=In%20Classical%20Greek%2C%20the%20word,forgetting%22%2C%20%22forgetfulness%22.
So lethe means forgetfullness, so an icy flowing forgetfullness?
'neath' is just a fancy word for beneath, but what is eldritch rime?
https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/eldritch#google_vignette
'eldritch' means strange and frightening.
https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/rime
'rime' refers to frost from low air temperature. Like a layer of white on grass after a cold night.

So uptil now I have icy flow of forgetfullness beneath a strange/frightening layer of frost. This could refer to a frozen river.
I know metals are considered frozen in alchemy. River could then refer to a melted state. No clue what strange/frightening has to do with it tho.

Okay there is and insane amount of metals that can be melted, I dont think I am going in the right direction. Will try and answer with a list to be sure.
Yea that did not work.
OMG I think I found it, I just now noticed the strange capital letters in the sentence.
https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Constrained-Writing-to-Send-a-Secret-Message
This seems to be a valid way to show a secret message, which it indeed is. The sentence spells S_I_L_V_E_R!!
Ok for some reason submitting silver does not work, although I feel like this has to be the answer. I will try different names.
I just realised I might be submitting my answers wrong, let me fix that.
Yes this was indeed the problem, becaus I started with using the same coding as last time I ended up having a lot of code that was not needed becaus I have a better answer submission code then last time.

Third challenge,
